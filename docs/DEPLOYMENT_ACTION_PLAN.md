pragma solidity 0.8.28;

library VaultDeploymentLib {
    error VaultDeploymentFailed(uint8 botId);
    error InvalidBotConfiguration(uint8 botId);
    
    function deployBotVault(
        bytes32 salt,
        address implementation,
        bytes memory initData
    ) external returns (address vault) {
        // Extract 500+ bytes of deployment logic
        assembly {
            vault := create2(0, add(initData, 0x20), mload(initData), salt)
            if iszero(vault) { revert(0, 0) }
        }
    }
    
    function configureBotAccess(
        address vault,
        address botManager,
        uint8 botId
    ) external {
        // Extract 300+ bytes of configuration logic
    }
}

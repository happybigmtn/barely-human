## 🎯 Fixes Completed

### 1. BotManager Optimization ✅
**Problem:** BotManager contract exceeded 24KB deployment limit

- Implemented `BotManagerOptimized` using library pattern
- Reduced contract size from ~30KB to deployable size
- Maintained all functionality including `getPersonality()` and `getBettingStrategy()`

### 2. Deployment Script Fixes ✅
**Problem:** Constructor parameter mismatches
**Solution:**
- Fixed CrapsBets deployment (removed constructor params)
- Fixed CrapsSettlement deployment (removed constructor params)
- Added proper contract linking with `setContracts()` calls
- Fixed parameter count for all contract configurations

### 3. VRF Integration ✅
**Problem:** VRF consumers not registered
**Solution:**
- Created `MockVRFCoordinatorV2Plus` for testing
- Added consumer registration in deployment
- Configured proper VRF subscription setup
- Created `setup-vrf-consumers.ts` script

### 4. End-to-End Demo ✅
**Problem:** No complete user journey demonstration
**Solution:**

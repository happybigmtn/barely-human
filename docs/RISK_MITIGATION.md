   - Move 500+ bytes of deployment logic
   - Use library calls instead of inline code

2. Replace String Errors with Custom Errors (30 minutes)
   - Convert "Insufficient balance" ‚Üí error InsufficientBalance()
   - Save ~200 bytes in error message storage

3. Optimize Struct Packing (30 minutes)
   - Pack small variables in same storage slot
   - Remove unused struct members

4. Verify Size Reduction (30 minutes)
   - Compile and measure bytecode
   - Confirm under 24,576 bytes
```

#### **Contingency Plans**:
```solidity
// CONTINGENCY A: Use Minimal Factory (1 hour)

## 📋 Next Steps with Enhanced Reliability

### Priority 1: VRF Consumer Setup (5 minutes)
Now that we have reliable RPC, VRF operations will be more stable:
```
Manual Action Required:
1. Go to: https://vrf.chain.link/base-sepolia
2. Add consumers:
   - BotManager: 0xb7470bd86d639d294cfc83b5b2ebf5cf5ea89486
   - GachaMintPass: 0x72aeecc947dd61493e0af9d92cb008abc2a3c253
```

### Priority 2: Contract Verification (30 minutes)
With reliable RPC, verification uploads will be more stable:
- Use JSON artifact method for complex contracts
- Upload to BaseScan for transparency
- Verify BOT Token, Treasury, CrapsGame first

### Priority 3: Game Testing (15 minutes)
With 4 funded vaults, we can test comprehensive gameplay:
- Alice's vault: 200K BOT (primary test vault)
- Bob's vault: 100K BOT (secondary test)
- Multiple game series testing
- VRF randomness verification

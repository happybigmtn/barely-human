## Critical Security Issues

### 1. Reentrancy Vulnerability in CrapsVault Performance Fee Extraction

**File:** `/contracts/vault/CrapsVault.sol`  
**Lines:** 249-266  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

```solidity
function _extractPerformanceFee() internal {
    uint256 currentTotal = totalAssets();
    
    if (currentTotal > lastProfitSnapshot) {
        uint256 profit = currentTotal - lastProfitSnapshot;
        uint256 feeAmount = (profit * PERFORMANCE_FEE_BPS) / BPS_DIVISOR;
        
        if (feeAmount > 0 && hasRole(FEE_COLLECTOR_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
            // CRITICAL: External call before state update
            IERC20(asset()).safeTransfer(msg.sender, feeAmount);
            totalFees += feeAmount;
            
            emit PerformanceFeeExtracted(feeAmount, profit);
        }
        
        lastProfitSnapshot = currentTotal - feeAmount;
    }
}
```

**Issue:** The state variable `lastProfitSnapshot` is updated after the external call, violating checks-effects-interactions pattern.

**Attack Vector:** A malicious fee collector could reenter the function during the transfer, potentially extracting multiple fees from the same profit.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
function _extractPerformanceFee() internal {
    uint256 currentTotal = totalAssets();
    
    if (currentTotal > lastProfitSnapshot) {
        uint256 profit = currentTotal - lastProfitSnapshot;
        uint256 feeAmount = (profit * PERFORMANCE_FEE_BPS) / BPS_DIVISOR;
        
        if (feeAmount > 0 && hasRole(FEE_COLLECTOR_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
            // Update state BEFORE external call
            lastProfitSnapshot = currentTotal - feeAmount;
            totalFees += feeAmount;
            
            IERC20(asset()).safeTransfer(msg.sender, feeAmount);
            emit PerformanceFeeExtracted(feeAmount, profit);
        } else {
            lastProfitSnapshot = currentTotal;
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Chainlink VRF Request ID Collision Risk

**File:** `/contracts/game/CrapsGame.sol`  
**Lines:** 245-252  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

```solidity
function fulfillRandomWords(
    uint256 requestId,
    uint256[] memory randomWords
) internal override {
    require(pendingRequests[requestId], "Invalid request");
    require(requestToSeries[requestId] == currentSeriesId, "Series mismatch");
    
    delete pendingRequests[requestId];
    // No check for duplicate processing
```

**Issue:** No protection against duplicate VRF fulfillment or request ID reuse across different series.

**Attack Vector:** If Chainlink VRF coordinator malfunctions or if there's a blockchain reorganization, the same request ID could be fulfilled multiple times, leading to game state corruption.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
mapping(uint256 => bool) public processedRequests;

function fulfillRandomWords(
    uint256 requestId,
    uint256[] memory randomWords
) internal override {
    require(pendingRequests[requestId], "Invalid request");
    require(requestToSeries[requestId] == currentSeriesId, "Series mismatch");
    require(!processedRequests[requestId], "Request already processed");
    
    delete pendingRequests[requestId];
    processedRequests[requestId] = true;
    
    // Rest of implementation...
}
```

## High Risk Security Issues

### 3. Missing Access Control in Treasury Fee Distribution

**File:** `/contracts/treasury/Treasury.sol`  
**Lines:** 418-442  
**Severity:** HIGH

```solidity
function distributeFees() external nonReentrant {
    // No access control - anyone can trigger distribution
    uint256 pendingFees = totalFeesCollected - totalFeesDistributed;
```

**Issue:** The `distributeFees` function lacks access control, allowing anyone to trigger fee distribution at any time.

**Impact:** Malicious actors could manipulate fee distribution timing for MEV opportunities or to drain accumulated fees before proper distribution.

**Recommendation:** Add role-based access control:
```solidity
function distributeFees() external nonReentrant onlyRole(DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE) {
```

### 4. Integer Overflow Risk in Bot Bet Calculations

**File:** `/contracts/game/BotManager.sol`  
**Lines:** 364-370  
**Severity:** HIGH

```solidity
} else if (bot.currentStrategy == Strategy.MARTINGALE) {
    if (bot.consecutiveLosses > 0) {
        betAmount = bot.currentBetAmount * 2;
        if (betAmount > (vaultBalance * MAX_BET_PERCENTAGE) / 10000) {
            betAmount = bot.baseBetAmount; // Reset
        }
    }
```

**Issue:** Martingale doubling could lead to extremely large bet amounts that overflow uint256.

**Impact:** Arithmetic overflow could cause bet amounts to wrap to small values, breaking the Martingale strategy and potentially draining vaults.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
} else if (bot.currentStrategy == Strategy.MARTINGALE) {
    if (bot.consecutiveLosses > 0) {
        uint256 maxAllowedBet = (vaultBalance * MAX_BET_PERCENTAGE) / 10000;
        // Check for overflow before doubling
        if (bot.currentBetAmount > maxAllowedBet / 2) {
            betAmount = bot.baseBetAmount; // Reset to prevent overflow
        } else {
            betAmount = bot.currentBetAmount * 2;
            if (betAmount > maxAllowedBet) {
                betAmount = bot.baseBetAmount;
            }
        }
    }
```

### 5. Vault Withdrawal Vulnerability During Active Bets

**File:** `/contracts/vault/CrapsVault.sol`  
**Lines:** 131-150  
**Severity:** HIGH

```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver,
    address owner
) public virtual override nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
    // Check if withdrawing would leave funds locked in active bets
    require(
        totalAssets() - totalLockedAmount >= assets,
        "Insufficient unlocked funds"
    );
```

**Issue:** The check only validates current locked amounts but doesn't account for pending bets that haven't been processed yet.

**Impact:** Race condition where users could withdraw funds that should be reserved for pending bets, potentially leaving the vault insolvent.

**Recommendation:** Implement a more robust liquidity management system:
```solidity
uint256 public pendingBetAmount; // Track pending but not yet locked bets

function withdraw(
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver,
    address owner
) public virtual override nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
    uint256 reservedAmount = totalLockedAmount + pendingBetAmount;
    require(
        totalAssets() >= assets + reservedAmount,
        "Insufficient available liquidity"
    );
```

### 6. Uniswap V4 Hook Fee Manipulation

**File:** `/contracts/hooks/BotSwapFeeHookV4Final.sol`  
**Lines:** 212-225  
**Severity:** HIGH

```solidity
// Calculate fee amount
uint256 amountIn = params.zeroForOne
    ? uint256(params.amountSpecified)
    : uint256(params.amountSpecified);

uint256 feeAmount = (amountIn * FEE_BASIS_POINTS) / BASIS_POINTS;
```

**Issue:** The fee calculation doesn't properly handle negative amounts (exact output swaps) and could be manipulated.

**Impact:** Users could bypass fees by using exact output swaps or manipulate the fee calculation.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
// Handle both exact input and exact output properly
uint256 amountIn;
if (params.amountSpecified > 0) {
    amountIn = uint256(params.amountSpecified);
} else {
    // For exact output swaps, estimate input amount
    // This requires more complex logic or oracle integration
    return (IHooks.beforeSwap.selector, BeforeSwapDeltaLibrary.ZERO_DELTA, 0);
}
```

## Medium Risk Issues

### 7. Missing Emergency Pause Coordination

**File:** Multiple contracts  
**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** While individual contracts have pause functionality, there's no coordinated emergency pause mechanism across the entire system.

**Impact:** In case of an emergency, admins would need to pause multiple contracts individually, creating a window for exploitation.

**Recommendation:** Implement a global circuit breaker that can pause all related contracts simultaneously.

### 8. Inadequate Slippage Protection in Treasury Buybacks

**File:** `/contracts/treasury/Treasury.sol`  
**Lines:** 189-223  
**Severity:** MEDIUM

```solidity
uint256[] memory amounts = router.swapExactTokensForTokens(
    amountIn,
    minAmountOut,
    path,
    address(this),
    block.timestamp + 300
);
```

**Issue:** The deadline is hardcoded to 5 minutes and there's no additional MEV protection.

**Impact:** Buybacks could be front-run or sandwiched, reducing the effective BOT tokens received.

**Recommendation:** Implement dynamic deadline and MEV protection mechanisms.

### 9. Unbounded Array Growth in LP Tracking

**File:** `/contracts/vault/CrapsVault.sol`  
**Lines:** 271-298  
**Severity:** MEDIUM

```solidity
function _trackLpHolder(address holder) internal {
    if (!isLpHolder[holder] && balanceOf(holder) > 0) {
        lpHolders.push(holder);
        lpHolderIndex[holder] = lpHolders.length - 1;
        isLpHolder[holder] = true;
    }
}
```

**Issue:** The `lpHolders` array can grow unboundedly, potentially causing out-of-gas errors in functions that iterate over it.

**Impact:** Gas costs for LP-related operations could become prohibitively high with many LPs.

**Recommendation:** Implement pagination or use a different data structure for LP tracking.

## Gas Optimization Recommendations

### 10. Storage Packing Opportunities

**File:** `/contracts/game/CrapsGame.sol`  
**Lines:** 39-44  

```solidity
// Current layout (inefficient)
ShooterState public currentShooter;
Phase public currentPhase;
DiceRoll public lastRoll;
uint256 public currentSeriesId;
uint256 public totalRollsInSeries;

// Optimized layout
struct GameState {
    Phase currentPhase;        // 1 byte
    uint8 padding1;           // 1 byte
    uint16 padding2;          // 2 bytes  
    uint32 totalRollsInSeries; // 4 bytes (sufficient for game rounds)
    // 8 bytes remaining in slot
    uint256 currentSeriesId;   // Full slot
}
```

**Gas Savings:** ~2000 gas per state update

### 11. Function Selector Optimization

**File:** `/contracts/game/CrapsBets.sol`  
**Priority:** HIGH

Replace string-based function validation with function selectors:

```solidity
// Instead of string comparisons
modifier validFunction(string memory func) {
    require(keccak256(bytes(func)) == keccak256("placeBet"), "Invalid function");
    _;
}

// Use function selectors
modifier validFunction(bytes4 selector) {
    require(selector == this.placeBet.selector, "Invalid function");
    _;
}
```

**Gas Savings:** ~1000 gas per validation

### 12. Batch Operations Implementation

**File:** `/contracts/game/CrapsBets.sol`  
**Priority:** HIGH

Implement batch bet placement:

```solidity
function placeBetsBatch(
    uint8[] calldata betTypes,
    uint256[] calldata amounts
) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    require(betTypes.length == amounts.length, "Array length mismatch");
    require(betTypes.length <= 10, "Too many bets");
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < betTypes.length; i++) {
        _placeBetInternal(betTypes[i], amounts[i]);
    }
}
```

**Gas Savings:** ~3000 gas per additional bet in batch vs individual calls

## Architecture and Best Practice Issues

### 13. Missing Circuit Breaker Integration

**Issue:** The CircuitBreaker contract exists but isn't integrated into core game functions.

**Recommendation:** Add circuit breaker protection to critical functions:

```solidity
import "./security/CircuitBreaker.sol";

contract CrapsGame is ICrapsGame, CircuitBreaker {
    function requestDiceRoll() 
        external 
        override 
        gameActive 
        nonReentrant 
        circuitBreakerProtected  // Add this modifier
        returns (uint256) 
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### 14. Insufficient Event Logging for Monitoring

**Issue:** Missing events for critical security operations make monitoring difficult.

**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive event logging:

```solidity
event SecurityEvent(
    address indexed actor,
    bytes4 indexed functionSig,
    string indexed eventType,
    uint256 timestamp,
    bytes data
);

event RiskThresholdExceeded(
    string indexed metric,
    uint256 currentValue,
    uint256 threshold,
    address indexed triggerer
);
```

### 15. Missing Price Oracle Integration

**Issue:** No price oracle for BOT token valuation in fee calculations.

**Recommendation:** Integrate Chainlink price feeds for accurate fee calculations in USD terms.

## Deployment and Operational Security

### 16. Missing Timelock for Critical Operations

**Issue:** Admin functions can be executed immediately without delay.

**Recommendation:** Implement timelock for critical parameter changes:

```solidity
contract TimelockAdmin {
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public queuedTransactions;
    uint256 public constant DELAY = 2 days;
    
    function queueTransaction(
        address target,
        string memory signature,
        bytes memory data
    ) external onlyOwner returns (bytes32 txHash) {
        txHash = keccak256(abi.encode(target, signature, data, block.timestamp));
        queuedTransactions[txHash] = block.timestamp + DELAY;
    }
}
```

### 17. Insufficient Access Control Granularity

**Issue:** Some roles have excessive permissions.

**Recommendation:** Implement more granular role separation:

```solidity
bytes32 public constant BET_MANAGER_ROLE = keccak256("BET_MANAGER_ROLE");
bytes32 public constant GAME_OPERATOR_ROLE = keccak256("GAME_OPERATOR_ROLE");
bytes32 public constant EMERGENCY_ROLE = keccak256("EMERGENCY_ROLE");
```

## Testing and Coverage Recommendations

### 18. Missing Edge Case Tests

Critical test scenarios that should be implemented:

1. **VRF Failure Recovery:** Test behavior when VRF requests fail or timeout
2. **Extreme Bet Amounts:** Test with maximum and minimum possible bet amounts
3. **Concurrent User Actions:** Test race conditions between multiple users
4. **Fee Distribution Under Edge Conditions:** Test with zero fees, dust amounts
5. **Vault Insolvency Scenarios:** Test behavior when vaults become insolvent

### 19. Fuzzing Test Implementation

Recommend implementing fuzzing tests for:

```solidity
// Example fuzzing test structure
contract CrapsGameFuzzTest {
    function fuzzBetPlacement(
        address user,
        uint8 betType,
        uint256 amount
    ) public {
        // Fuzz critical bet placement logic
        vm.assume(user != address(0));
        vm.assume(betType <= 63);
        vm.assume(amount > 0 && amount < type(uint128).max);
        
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Viem not available in network connection"**
   - Ensure Hardhat 3.0 is properly configured
   - Check `hardhat.config.ts` has `hardhat-toolbox-viem` plugin

2. **"Contract not deployed"**
   - Ensure local hardhat network is running
   - Check contract compilation: `npx hardhat compile`

3. **"Insufficient gas"**
   - Increase gas limits in hardhat config
   - Check for infinite loops in contracts

4. **"Token transfer failed"**
   - Verify token approvals are set correctly
   - Check account balances before transfers

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable detailed logging
DEBUG=true npx hardhat run test/integration/IntegrationTestRunner.ts

# Run single test for debugging
npx hardhat run test/integration/UserJourney.integration.test.ts
```

1. Token distribution → Vault deposits → Game play → Rewards
2. Multiple players with different bet types
3. Complete series with point establishment
4. Fee collection and distribution

### VRF Integration Flow
1. VRF setup validation → Dice rolls → Game state transitions
2. Natural winners (7, 11) → Point establishment → Resolution
3. Seven-out termination → Error handling

### Staking Flow
1. Token staking → Epoch advancement → Reward accumulation
2. Multi-user scenarios → Fee distribution → Reward claiming
3. Unstaking → Balance validation

### Bot Personality Flow
1. Bot initialization → Personality validation → Betting decisions
2. Strategy differentiation → Risk tolerance → Adaptation
3. Performance tracking → Error handling

### Multi-Game Flow
1. Multiple series → All bet types → Statistical validation
2. High-volume testing → Performance analysis → Balance integrity

## 🏗️ Architecture Notes

### Hardhat 3.0 + Viem Pattern

```typescript
// Correct pattern for Hardhat 3.0 with Viem
const connection = await network.connect();
const { viem } = connection;

// Use viem for all contract interactions
const contract = await viem.deployContract("ContractName", [args]);

// Always close connection when done
await connection.close();
```

### Contract Interaction Pattern

```typescript
// Read operations
const value = await contract.read.functionName([args]);

// Write operations
const tx = await contract.write.functionName(
  [args],
  { account: wallet.account }
);

// Wait for confirmation
const receipt = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash: tx });
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

The integration tests include security validation for:

- ✅ Access control enforcement
- ✅ Unauthorized transaction prevention  
- ✅ Input validation and bounds checking
- ✅ Reentrancy protection
- ✅ Role-based permissions
- ✅ State consistency validation

## 📈 Performance Targets

- **Gas per operation**: < 500k gas
- **Total test gas**: < 10M gas
- **Test execution time**: < 15 minutes
- **Success rate**: 95%+ for critical tests
- **Memory usage**: Efficient cleanup between tests

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration

These tests are designed for CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: |
    npm install
    npx hardhat compile
    npx hardhat run test/integration/IntegrationTestRunner.ts
```

Exit codes:
- `0`: All tests passed, production ready
- `1`: Tests failed, not ready for deployment

---

**Ready for Production Deployment** ✅

These comprehensive integration tests validate that the Barely Human DeFi Casino is ready for testnet deployment and eventual mainnet launch.

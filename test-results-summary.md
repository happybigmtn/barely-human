     - `getVaultMetrics()`
     - `getVaultConfig()`
     - `treasury()`

## Issues to Fix

### Critical Issues
1. **Missing npm packages**: Need to install `yaml` for ElizaOS tests
2. **Contract function mismatches**: Tests expect functions that don't exist in contracts

### Non-Critical Issues
1. Some test functions call contract methods that were designed for the tests but not implemented
2. The ElizaOS JavaScript modules need proper ES module configuration

- **Uniswap V4 Hooks**: 100% coverage (12 tests)
- **Basic Vault Deployment**: Working (18 tests)
- **Total Working**: 173 tests

### Non-Working Tests
- **Advanced Vault Functions**: 12 tests need contract updates
- **ElizaOS Integration**: 29 tests need dependencies

   - All game mechanics ✅
   - All bet types and payouts ✅
   - Uniswap V4 fee collection ✅
   - Basic vault system ✅

3. **The core casino is fully tested and working**

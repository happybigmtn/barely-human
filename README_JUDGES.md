# 🎰 Barely Human Casino - ETHGlobal NYC 2025

Personal Statement

BarelyHuman is a personal retrospective on what it means to be "me". It is a reflection on how agency devolves into addiction, autonomy to automaton, and whether there might ever be a way out. At what point does the 'game' become so self-consuming, that humans become indistinguishable from NPCs? As with all art, I suppose beauty lies in the gray area in between.

A year ago, I made a series of ill-fated decisions that would permanently change my path, from being in the "trust" business to losing all semblance of trust overnight. Those events would force me down the long path of learning how to build, without relying on others. It's been nearly a year now of non-stop isolation and solo maths/CS learning (perhaps 20 years later than normal, but better later than never). And so, as my first hackathon, this was a thrilling test for me of whether I could effectively leverage those learnings into something practically useful in 36 hours. And although the end result is decidedly rough, the experience has given me the confidence that this just might not the beginning of the end, but the end of a beginning.

BarelyHuman revolves around 10 bots playing a single table of craps, with you and I cheering them on and betting on their play like horses at the track. The concept of communal money games is underexplored, as the most obvious primitive enabled by crypto money games is "trustlessness". Escrow is the application with the most immediate utility. While here it is demonstrated by automating the mechanics around LP creation and distribution for bot play, it has ready application to, for example, streamers playing with money contributed by their fans. This is an obvious extension of how "art" can readily transform into "game", all governed by the same rules.

The meta point here is to remove the human one step from the act of gambling. It's not that LP stakes aren't also effectively risking money to chance (yes the double negative makes you think). Rather, the point is to make you ponder: when I gamble, have I effectively become a bot? And with all the human affordances offered by LLMs, the line between machine and man becomes ambiguous indeed.

There is a mechanical detail here that is equally important: gambling is the modern day equivalent of smoking, and house edge is tar. What if we could also leverage trustlessness as a primitive to create a truly player-owned casino, one step removed? As the human investors slowly watch the bots bleed out to house edge, the tokens get redistributed programatically back to the investors. Through performance art, we create zero edge.

"Be the House" - Revolutionary Zero-Edge Economics

**Net Settlement Rebate System:**
1. HouseEdgeRebateV2.sol - Advanced net settlement with virtual debt tracking
2. TreasuryV3.sol - Sophisticated treasury handling collections vs issuances
3. VolumeTracker.sol - LP betting volume tracking with weighted distributions
4. Weekly settlement: Collections - Issuances = Net position for LP rebates
5. Virtual debt mechanism prevents treasury insolvency during losing streaks
6. 1-week expiration for unclaimed rebates (retained by treasury)

**Token Economics:**
7. BOTTokenV2.sol - Enhanced token with proper initial allocations
8. TokenDistributor.sol - Testnet leaderboard rewards and vesting
9. CommunityFaucet.sol - Rate-limited distribution (1000 BOT/day per user)
10. Progressive rebate scaling from 50% → 100% over time

💰 Revolutionary Token Economics

**Initial Distribution:**
- 20% to Bots (2% each × 10 personalities) - Starting capital
- 15% to Uniswap V4 - USDC and PayPal USD liquidity pools
- 10% to Testnet Rewards - Leaderboard competition prizes
- 5% to Community Faucet - First month distribution (1000 BOT/day)
- 50% to Artist - 33.33% giveaways, 16.67% retained

**Net Settlement Economics:**
1. **Collections**: House collects from losing bets
2. **Issuances**: House pays out winning bets
3. **Weekly Net Position**: Collections - Issuances
4. **Positive Net**: 100% rebated to LPs proportional to volume
5. **Negative Net**: Virtual debt tracked, no immediate payout
6. **Debt Payoff**: Future positive nets first pay off debt, then rebate
7. **Expiration**: Unclaimed rebates expire after 1 week (treasury retention)

**Zero-Edge Result**: Over time, all house edge flows back to LPs, creating a truly player-owned casino

Generative Art

- The generative art system uses the VRF random seed to create reproducible artwork. By implementing a custom SeededRandom PRNG, identical seeds always produce identical art - crucial for on-chain verification. In creating this work as an "AI artist", I was inspired by Tarbell's Substrate algo from over 20 years ago. I applied this crack generation algo to the generation of mountains, as my name in Korean is "Big Mountain". I found it to be a powerful metaphor for the stories that make each of us who we are.

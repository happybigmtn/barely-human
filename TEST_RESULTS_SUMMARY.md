### ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **CrapsSettlement Size**
   - Issue: Contract size warning during deployment
   - Impact: May need optimization for mainnet
   - Workaround: Using optimized deployment script

2. **Test Runner**
   - Issue: `test-runner.ts` script missing
   - Impact: Cannot run full test suite automatically
   - Workaround: Run individual test files

3. **Demo Script**
   - Issue: Some contracts too large in demo
   - Impact: Full demo may fail on deployment
   - Workaround: Use simplified deployment script

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Core Smart Contracts**
   - All contracts compile without errors
   - Optimized versions fit deployment limits
   - Core functionality implemented

2. **Token System**
   - BOT token fully functional
   - Staking system operational
   - Treasury integration working

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Hardhat 3 + Viem pattern established
   - Individual test files execute correctly
   - Good test coverage on core contracts

---

## 🔧 Recommendations

### For ETHGlobal Submission
1. **Use Working Tests**: Focus on BOTToken and StakingPool tests for demo
2. **Deploy Optimized Contracts**: Use BotManagerOptimized and VaultFactoryUltraOptimized
3. **Run Individual Tests**: Execute specific test files rather than suite

### For Production
1. **Fix Test Runner**: Create proper test orchestration script
2. **Optimize Contract Sizes**: Further reduce CrapsSettlement size
3. **Complete Integration Tests**: Ensure all integration tests can execute

---

## 🎯 Verdict

**The project has sufficient working tests to demonstrate functionality for ETHGlobal NYC 2025:**

- ✅ Core contracts tested and working
- ✅ Token system fully operational
- ✅ Deployment scripts functional with optimizations
- ✅ Individual test files execute successfully

**Confidence Level: 85%** - The core functionality is solid and demonstrable, with some peripheral testing infrastructure needing completion.
